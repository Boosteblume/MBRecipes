This is the recipe for a no-bake american cheesecake with lotus biscoti cake base and an apple-sugar-cinnamon topping.



## Ingredients
_the sizes below are german sizes_
- 1 Package of Lotus Biscoti
- 100g Butter
- a pinch of salt
- 600g Philladelphia Doppelrahmstufe cream cheese
- 200g Sour cream (Schmand)
- 200ml cream
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 4 apples, peeled and thinly sliced
- Around 1 tablespoon of cinnamon
- Around 100g of sugar
- 12 leafs of gelatin

## Instructions

1. **Crush the cookies**: Crush the lotus cookies into very small bits. You can either just beat them or use a Kitchen mixer.

2. **Mix cookies, butter and salt**: 
    - Melt the 60g of butter.
    - In a bowl, combine the crushed biscots, melted butter and add salt.
    - After you thouroughly mixed everything, press the mixture into the bottom of a 26inch (26Zoll) springform pan to form the crust.
    - Wait at least 40 minutes before you continue with the next step.

3. **Make Cheesecake Filling**:
    - In a bowl (I would adivse to use a bigger bowl for this) mix the cream cheese,, sour cream and the  and vanilla extract until smooth.
    - Prepare 6 leafs of the gelatin for the mixture by leaving it in cold water for 5 minutes.
    - After 5 minutes squeeze the gelatin leafes. Following that heat the gelatine leaves and stir the leaves constantly untill you got one smooth liquid.
    - Mix the liquid with some (I used 2) tablespoons of the cream mix.
    - Mix the rest of the cream with the gelatin liquid.
    - Whip the cream until stiff.
    - Fold in the cream cheese mixture with the cream.
    - Pour the filling over the prepared crust.
    - Wait at least 4 hours before you continue.

4. **Prepare Apple Topping**:
    - Peel and cut the apples into a form of your choice (I choose dices).
    - Put 40 gramm of butter into a pot add the apple pieces, add 100 gramm of sugar and finally add the table spoon of cinnamon.
    - Arrange the apple slices on top of the cheesecake filling.
    - Let it simmer for at least 10min. 
    - After the apple pieces reached the desired squishnes move them away from the heat.
    - Start to prepare the last 6 leafes of gelatin. Same procedure as before. (Wait 5min, heat them untill liquid).
    - Mix the gelatin liquid with around 200ml water.
    - Finally mix the gelating liquid with the cooling apple-cinnanom mixture.
    - Pour the Apple-cinnamon mixture over the filling.
    - Put it back in the fridge asap.

5. **Bake**:
    - Wait for a couple of hours (I waited over night.)

6. **Serve**: Remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!

## Notes
- I added some gold glitter spray on top to make it extra shiny.
