This is the recipe for a no-bake american cheesecake with lotus biscoti cake base and an apple-sugar-cinnamon topping.



## Ingredients
_the sizes below are german sizes_
- 1 Package of Leibnitz Butterkekse
- 100g Butter
- a pinch of salt
- 600g Philladelphia Doppelrahmstufe cream cheese
- 200g Sour cream (Schmand)
- 200ml cream
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 120g of sugar
- 9 leafs of gelatin (or just use 2 packs)
- 2 glasses of fruit spread (aim for the highest percentage of fruit possible, I used 75%) 

## Instructions

1. **Crush the cookies**: Crush the Leibnitz cookies into very small bits. You can either just beat them or use a Kitchen mixer.

2. **Mix cookies, butter and salt**: 
    - Melt the 100g of butter.
    - In a bowl, combine the crushed leibnitz cookies, melted butter and add salt.
    - After you thouroughly mixed everything, press the mixture into the bottom of a 26inch (26Zoll) springform pan to form the crust.
    - Wait at least 40 minutes before you continue with the next step.

3. **Make Cheesecake Filling**:
    - In a bowl (I would adivse to use a bigger bowl for this) mix the cream cheese,, sour cream and the  and vanilla extract until smooth.
    - Prepare 6 leafs of the gelatin for the mixture by leaving it in cold water for 5 minutes.
    - After 5 minutes squeeze the gelatin leafes. Following that heat the gelatine leaves and stir the leaves constantly untill you got one smooth liquid.
    - Mix the liquid with some (I used 2) tablespoons of the cream mix.
    - Mix the rest of the cream with the gelatin liquid.
    - Whip the cream until stiff.
    - Fold in the cream cheese mixture with the cream.
    - Pour the filling over the prepared crust.
    - Wait at least 4 hours before you continue.

4. **Prepare Topping**:
    - Pour the glasses of fruit spread into a pot, heat it untill liquid.
    - Prepare the gelatin as seen above.
    - Mix the gelatin liquid with around 200ml water.
    - Mix the gelatin mix with the fruit spread.
    - Pour the mixture onto the cheescake.
    - Back in the fridge and wait. 


5. **Let it rest**:
    - Wait for a couple of hours (I waited over night.)

6. **Serve**: Remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!
