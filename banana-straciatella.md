- 3 bananas 
- 450g Stracciatella yogurt
- 3 tablespoons of lemon juice
- 1 package of vanilla sugar
- 6 leafs of gelatin

## Instructions

1. **Mix butter, coca and baking powder**: 
    - Melt the 100g of butter.
    - Mix the flour, coca and baking powder in a bowl, but use a sieve when adding the ingredients.
    - Mix the flour mixture with suggar, the melted butter, the 4 tbsp of water and the 2 eggs.
    - Stir the mixture untill flat.
    - Use some extra butter to greas the springform pan. (I used a 26inch(26 Zoll) Form).
    - Fill the mixture into the springform and put it into the preheated oven.
    - Bake for 20-25min with 175 Grad Celsius (Time can differ with different ovens).
    - Wait untill the baked dough has cooled down before you continue.

2. **Make the cream**:
    - Peel 2 bananas and cut them into slices.
    - Drip the 2 tbsp of lemon juice onto the banana slices.
    - Mix the yogurt and the vanilla sugar.
    - Prepare 6 leafs of the gelatin for the mixture by leaving it in cold water for 5 minutes.
    - After 5 minutes squeeze the gelatin leafes. Following that heat the gelatine leaves and stir the leaves constantly untill you got one smooth liquid.
    - Mix the gelatin liquid with around 2 tbsp of the yogurt mixture. Stir for a little.
    - Mix the rest of the yogurt with the gelatin mix.
    - Whip the cream until stiff.
    - Fold the stiff cream into the yogurt mix.

3. **Prepare the cake**:
    - Use the chilled baked dough and cut it into 2 slices.
    - Put the first slice into a cake ring.
    - Put 3-4 tbsp of the yogurt mix onto the slice.
    - Put the banana slices onto the yogurt mix.
    - Put the second slice into the cake ring.
    - Put the rest of the yogurt mix on the slice.
    - Put the decoration on top of the cake.


5. **Let it rest**:
    - Wait for a couple of hours, at least 2 hours (I waited over night.)

6. **Serve**: Remove the cake ring, slice, and enjoy!

## Notes
- I always put all the banana slices into the middle, you can also leave some and put them on top of the cake as decoration.
